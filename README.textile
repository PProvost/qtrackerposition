QTrackerPosition is simply repositions the quest watcher, achievement watcher and achievement
alert frames to where I want them.

* Achievement tracker is near the top, about 1/3 of the way over from the left
* Quest tracker is near the top, about 1/3 of the way over from the right
* Achievement alert frame is centered near the top

I might make the positions configurable some day, but for now they are hard coded. If you don't 
like the positions, open the code and change em!
