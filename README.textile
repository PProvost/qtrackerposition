QTrackerPosition is simply repositions my quest watcher and achievement watcher frames to where I wanted them.

* Achievement tracker is near the top, about 1/3 of the way over from the left
* Quest tracker is near the top, about 1/3 of the way over from the right

I might make the position configurable some day, but for now they are hard coded. If you don't like the positions, 
open the code and change em!
